      <img class = "services" src ="/Assests/images/goblingame.png">
      <p>
        As the developer tasked with remaking a simple canvas game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, my role involved creating an 
        interactive and engaging gaming experience. The objective of the game was to control a character on the screen using the arrow 
        keys on a laptop and try to hit goblins as they appeared. Each successful hit would earn the player a point, and a tally kept 
        track of the number of goblins caught.

                the arrow keys on the laptop. This feature enhanced the player's control over the game and provided a dynamic gameplay experience.
            </li>

            <li>
                Goblin Spawning: Using JavaScript, I programmed the goblins to appear at random positions on the canvas. The goblins' 
                movement patterns and speed were also defined to create a challenging gameplay environment.
            </li>

            <li>
                Hit Detection and Scoring: I incorporated hit detection functionality to determine when the player successfully hit a 
                goblin with the character. Each successful hit incremented the player's score and updated the tally of goblins caught. 
                This scoring system added a competitive aspect to the game and motivated players to achieve a higher score.
            </li>
        </ol>
      <p>
        Technologies used in remaking the canvas game include JavaScript for implementing the game logic, HTML for creating the 
        canvas element and structuring  the game's elements, and CSS for styling and visual enhancements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The outcome of remaking the canvas game was a fun and addictive gaming experience. Players could control the character 
        using the arrow keys on their laptop, providing a familiar and intuitive control scheme. The challenge of hitting the goblins 
        as they swarmed in kept players engaged and motivated to improve their skills. The scoring system and tally of goblins caught 
        added an element of achievement and competition to the game.
      </p>

      <p>
