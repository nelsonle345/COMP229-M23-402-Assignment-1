      <img class = "services" src ="/Assests/images/artgallery.png">
      <p>
        As a developer for an art gallery website, my role was to create a dynamic and visually appealing platform using JavaScript, 
        HTML, and CSS. The primary objective was to showcase a collection of artworks, with the ability to automatically rotate images 
        every 30 seconds. Additionally, I implemented functionality to allow users to 
        manually change the set of pictures, as well as navigate between the previous and next images.
      </p>

        Key accomplishments in developing the art gallery website include:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Image Rotation: I utilized JavaScript to implement a timer function that automatically changed the displayed 
                image every 30 seconds. This feature created a dynamic and engaging experience for visitors, showcasing a variety of artworks without user intervention.
            </li>

            <li>
                Picture Set Selection: I added a button that enabled users to manually change the set of pictures being displayed. 
                By clicking on this button, visitors could explore different collections of artworks, providing a personalized browsing experience.
            </li>

            <li>
                Navigation Buttons: I incorporated buttons for users to navigate between the previous and next pictures. This functionality 
                allowed visitors to have more control over their viewing experience, enabling them to go back to a previous artwork or skip to the next one.
            </li>
