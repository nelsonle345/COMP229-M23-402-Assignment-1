      Add a short paragraph about yourself here. Introduce yourself, mention your skills or areas of expertise,
      highlight your accomplishments or experiences, and briefly describe your professional goals.

  My name is Nelson Le. I am currently enrolled in Software Engineering Technology at Centennial College.
  I previously went to George Brown College for mechanical technician specializing in CNC and precision machining. I am currently working as a research and development technician in the medical field. I have always been intrigued with writing codes and the result in a brand-new product,
  which is why I decided to finish do CNC as I also enjoy doing hands on work. However, I always wanted to try out software engineering, which is why I have decided to change my focus for my career
  to software engineering. However, I still strive to continue learning more about CNC and machining processes. As it still, interests me and is enjoyable to do!
